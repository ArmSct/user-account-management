# Managing User Accounts in Active Directory
This project demonstrates how to simulate and manage Active Directory account lockouts in a Microsoft Azure environment. The lab includes configuring Group Policy to enforce lockout thresholds, triggering account lockouts through failed login attempts, unlocking and resetting accounts, enabling/disabling users, and reviewing event logs on both the domain controller and client machine.

## Technologies Utlizied

- Windows Server
- Windows 10 
- Active Directory (AD DS)
- Group Policy Management
