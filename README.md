# Managing User Accounts in Active Directory
This project demonstrates configuring Group Policy to enforce lockout thresholds, triggering account lockouts through failed login attempts, unlocking and resetting accounts, enabling/disabling users, and reviewing event logs on both the domain controller and client machine. A domain controller (DC-1) and client (Client-1) virtual machine are pre-configured for this lab.

## Technologies Utlizied
- Microsoft Azure
- Windows Server
- Windows 10 
- Active Directory
- Group Policy Management
- Event Viewer
- Remote Desktop (RDP)

## Actions and Observations

### Account Lockouts 
Log in to the Domain Controller (DC-1) and open Active Directory Users and Computers. Create a Default Domain Policy that locks out users after 5 failed login attempts.

On the client machine,  attempt to log in with this user account 5 times with an incorrect password. This will result in the account being locked.

On the domain controller, open Active Directory Users and Computers. Search for the user's account name. Click on the user and check the unlock account box and click OK.

Confirm that the account has been unlocked by logging in as the user on the client machine.

### Enable/Disable User Accounts

In ADUC, right-click the user account and disable their account.

Attempt to log in from the client. You will receive an error ("The logon attempt failed") indicating the account is disabled.

On the domain controller, re-enable the account. As the client, test logging in again with the correct credentials.
